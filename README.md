## About this fork

This is a fork of [tradesdontlie/tradingview-mcp](https://github.com/tradesdontlie/tradingview-mcp) (MIT). It adds an optional **pipe transport** that removes the TCP debug port, and fixes six bugs reported upstream. Everything else, including all 84 tools, works exactly as in the original.

| Branch | What it adds |
|---|---|
| `feat/pipe-transport` | Pipe transport (opt-in; port mode stays the default) |
| `fix/confirmed-bugs` | Pipe transport + the six bug fixes below. **Use this one.** |

### Pipe transport: no open debug port

The original connects to TradingView through `--remote-debugging-port=9222`. That port has no authentication: while it is open, **any program on your computer** can take full control of TradingView, including your logged-in session and the trading panel.

With the pipe transport, a small broker launches TradingView with `--remote-debugging-pipe` instead. The debugger is reached through a private pipe between the two processes, and the broker shares it with the MCP through a Unix socket that only your user account can open:

```
Claude Code session ┐
another session     ┼─► cdp.sock (0600, in a 0700 folder) ─► broker ─► pipe ─► TradingView
tv CLI              ┘
```

| | Port mode (default) | Pipe mode |
|---|---|---|
| TradingView flag | `--remote-debugging-port=9222` | `--remote-debugging-pipe` |
| TCP port opened | `127.0.0.1:9222` | none |
| Who can control TradingView | any local program | your user account only (socket is `0600`) |
| Shared by several Claude sessions | yes | yes (the broker routes each client's sessions separately) |

**Turn it on** by adding `TV_CDP_TRANSPORT=pipe` to the server's environment, for example in `~/.claude.json`:

```json
"tradingview": {
  "type": "stdio",
  "command": "node",
  "args": ["/path/to/tradingview-mcp/src/server.js"],
  "env": { "TV_CDP_TRANSPORT": "pipe" }
}
```

Then restart Claude Code and start TradingView with the `tv_launch` tool (or `TV_CDP_TRANSPORT=pipe tv launch`). `tv_launch` starts the broker, and the broker starts TradingView. `tv_health_check` reports `"transport": "pipe"`.

- **Socket:** `~/Library/Application Support/tradingview-mcp/cdp.sock` on macOS, `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/tradingview-mcp/cdp.sock` on Linux. Override with `TV_PIPE_SOCKET`.
- **Broker log:** `broker.log` in the same folder.
- **Manual start:** `node src/pipe/broker.js [--socket <path>] [--tv <binary>]`.
- **Joins a running broker:** if the Awesome Charts app (or another session) already runs the broker, `tv_launch` joins it instead of restarting TradingView.
- **Lifetime:** the broker exits when TradingView quits. Opening TradingView from the Dock or Start menu starts it without any debugger, so use `tv_launch`.
- **Limits:** only one program can launch TradingView, so tools that start it themselves (or expect port 9222, such as `scripts/pine_*.js`) don't work at the same time. Windows uses a named pipe, but pipe mode has only been tested on macOS.

Verified live on TradingView Desktop 3.4.1 (Electron 41) on macOS: every tool group works over the pipe, and `lsof` shows no TCP listener from TradingView or the broker.

### Bug fixes

| Issue | Problem | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| [#527](https://github.com/tradesdontlie/tradingview-mcp/issues/527) | Boolean parameters read the string `"false"` as **true**, so `alert_delete` with `delete_all: "false"` deleted every alert, and `tv_launch` with `kill_existing: "false"` still killed TradingView | All 8 boolean parameters accept only real booleans or the words `true`/`false`, and reject anything else. `alert_delete` also refuses a non-boolean `delete_all`. |
| [#475](https://github.com/tradesdontlie/tradingview-mcp/issues/475) | `pine_new` wrote its template into whichever script was open, so the next save overwrote it | `pine_new` creates a real untitled script through the editor's **Create new** menu and checks that the editor switched. If the open script has unsaved changes, it cancels TradingView's prompt and stops. |
| [#395](https://github.com/tradesdontlie/tradingview-mcp/issues/395) | `pine_compile` / `pine_smart_compile` / `pine_save` could save the source over a different saved script | They refuse when the editor holds a saved script whose name differs from the title declared in the source. Override on purpose with `allow_title_mismatch: true` (CLI: `--allow-title-mismatch`). |
| [#477](https://github.com/tradesdontlie/tradingview-mcp/issues/477) | `ui_mouse_click` sent left clicks as "no button pressed" and reported success | Uses the correct button mask (left=1, right=2, middle=4); double clicks fire a real `dblclick`. |
| [#476](https://github.com/tradesdontlie/tradingview-mcp/issues/476) | `ui_evaluate` returned `{}` for async expressions | Promises are awaited and their resolved value returned. |
| [#553](https://github.com/tradesdontlie/tradingview-mcp/issues/553) | `tab_new` clicked the new-tab button's wrapper, which does nothing | Clicks the button itself, with fallbacks. |

The fixes for #527, #553, #475 and #395 follow the approach of upstream PRs [#528](https://github.com/tradesdontlie/tradingview-mcp/pull/528), [#553](https://github.com/tradesdontlie/tradingview-mcp/pull/553) and [#555](https://github.com/tradesdontlie/tradingview-mcp/pull/555). All six were verified live on TradingView Desktop 3.4.1 through the MCP server.

### Tests

`npm run test:unit` covers the additions: `tests/pipe.test.js` (framing, broker routing, session isolation, cleanup, socket permissions), `tests/schema.test.js` (#527), `tests/ui_fixes.test.js` (#477, #476, #553) and `tests/pine_save_guard.test.js` (#395, #475).

## How It Works (and why it's safe to run)

This tool does not connect to TradingView's servers, modify any TradingView files, or intercept any network traffic. It communicates exclusively with your locally running TradingView Desktop instance via Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP) — a standard debugging interface built into all Chromium/Electron applications by Google, including VS Code, Slack, and Discord.

The debug port is disabled by default and must be explicitly enabled by you using a standard Chromium flag (`--remote-debugging-port=9222`). Nothing happens without that deliberate step.

## What This Tool Does Not Do

- Connect to TradingView's servers or APIs
- Store, transmit, or redistribute any market data
- Work without a valid TradingView subscription and installed Desktop app
- Bypass any TradingView paywall or access restriction
- Execute real trades (chart interaction only)
- Work if TradingView changes their internal Electron structure

## Research Context

This project explores an open research question: **how can LLM-based agents interact with professional trading interfaces to support human decision-making?**

Specifically it investigates:

- How structured tool APIs (MCP) can bridge LLMs and stateful desktop financial applications
- What latency, context, and reliability constraints emerge when an agent operates on live chart data
- How agents handle ambiguous financial UI state (e.g. interpreting Pine Script output, reading indicator tables)
- Whether natural language is an effective interface for chart navigation and Pine Script development
- The failure modes of LLM agents operating in real-time data environments

This is not a trading bot. It is an interface layer that makes a trading application legible to an LLM agent, allowing researchers and developers to study human-AI collaboration in financial workflows.

See [RESEARCH.md](RESEARCH.md) for open questions, findings, and related work.

## Prerequisites

- **TradingView Desktop app** (paid subscription required for real-time data)
- **Node.js 18+**
- **Claude Code** with MCP support (for MCP tools) or any terminal (for CLI)
- **macOS, Windows, or Linux**

## What It Does

Gives your AI assistant eyes and hands on your own chart:

- **Pine Script development** — write, inject, compile, debug, and iterate on scripts with AI assistance
- **Chart navigation** — change symbols, timeframes, zoom to dates, add/remove indicators
- **Visual analysis** — read your chart's indicator values, price levels, and annotations
- **Draw on charts** — trend lines, horizontal lines, rectangles, text annotations
- **Manage alerts** — create, list, and delete price alerts
- **Replay practice** — step through historical bars, practice entries/exits
- **Screenshots** — capture chart state for AI visual analysis
- **Multi-pane layouts** — set up 2x2, 3x1, etc. grids with different symbols per pane
- **Monitor your chart** — stream JSONL from your locally running chart for local monitoring scripts
- **CLI access** — every MCP tool is also a `tv` CLI command, pipe-friendly with JSON output
- **Launch TradingView** — auto-detect and launch with debug mode from any platform

## Install with Claude Code

Paste this into Claude Code and it will handle the rest:

> Install the TradingView MCP server. Clone https://github.com/tradesdontlie/tradingview-mcp.git, run npm install, add it to my MCP config at ~/.claude/.mcp.json, and launch TradingView with the debug port. Then verify the connection with tv_health_check.

Or follow the manual steps below.

## Quick Start

### 1. Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tradesdontlie/tradingview-mcp.git
cd tradingview-mcp
npm install
```

### 2. Launch TradingView with CDP

TradingView Desktop must be running with Chrome DevTools Protocol enabled on port 9222.

**Mac:**
```bash
./scripts/launch_tv_debug_mac.sh
```

**Windows:**
```bash
scripts\launch_tv_debug.bat
```

**Linux:**
```bash
./scripts/launch_tv_debug_linux.sh
```

**Or launch manually on any platform:**
```bash
/path/to/TradingView --remote-debugging-port=9222
```

**Or use the MCP tool** (auto-detects your install):
> "Use tv_launch to start TradingView in debug mode"

### 3. Add to Claude Code

Add to your Claude Code MCP config (`~/.claude/.mcp.json` or project `.mcp.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "tradingview": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/tradingview-mcp/src/server.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

Replace `/path/to/tradingview-mcp` with your actual path.

### 4. Verify

Ask Claude: *"Use tv_health_check to verify TradingView is connected"*

## CLI

Every MCP tool is also accessible as a `tv` CLI command. All output is JSON for piping with `jq`.

```bash
# Install globally (optional)
npm link

# Or run directly
node src/cli/index.js <command>
```

### Quick Examples

```bash
tv status                          # check connection
tv quote                           # current price
tv symbol AAPL                     # change symbol
tv ohlcv --summary                 # price summary
tv screenshot -r chart             # capture chart
tv pine compile                    # compile Pine Script
tv pane layout 2x2                 # 4-chart grid
tv pane symbol 1 ES1!              # set pane symbol
tv stream quote | jq '.close'      # monitor price changes
```

### All Commands

```
tv status / launch / state / symbol / timeframe / type / info / search
tv quote / ohlcv / values
tv data lines/labels/tables/boxes/strategy/trades/equity/depth/indicator
tv pine get/set/compile/analyze/check/save/new/open/list/errors/console
tv draw shape/list/get/remove/clear
tv alert list/create/delete
tv watchlist get/add
tv indicator add/remove/toggle/set/get
tv layout list/switch

tv stream quote/bars/values/lines/labels/tables/all
tv ui click/keyboard/hover/scroll/find/eval/type/panel/fullscreen/mouse
tv screenshot / discover / ui-state / range / scroll
```

## Streaming

The `tv stream` commands poll your locally running TradingView Desktop instance at regular intervals via Chrome DevTools Protocol on localhost.

No connection is made to TradingView's servers. All data stays on your machine.

> [!WARNING]
> Programmatic consumption of TradingView data may conflict with their Terms of Use regardless of the data source. You are solely responsible for ensuring your usage complies.

```bash
tv stream quote                          # price tick monitoring
tv stream bars                           # bar-by-bar updates
tv stream values                         # indicator value monitoring
tv stream lines --filter "NY Levels"     # price level monitoring
tv stream tables --filter Profiler       # table data monitoring
tv stream all                            # all panes at once (multi-symbol)
```

## How Claude Knows Which Tool to Use

Claude reads [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) automatically when working in this project. It contains a complete decision tree:

| You say... | Claude uses... |
|------------|---------------|
| "What's on my chart?" | `chart_get_state` → `data_get_study_values` → `quote_get` |
| "What levels are showing?" | `data_get_pine_lines` → `data_get_pine_labels` |
| "Read the session table" | `data_get_pine_tables` with `study_filter` |
| "Give me a full analysis" | `quote_get` → `data_get_study_values` → `data_get_pine_lines` → `data_get_pine_labels` → `data_get_pine_tables` → `data_get_ohlcv` (summary) → `capture_screenshot` |
| "Switch to AAPL daily" | `chart_set_symbol` → `chart_set_timeframe` |
| "Write a Pine Script for..." | `pine_set_source` → `pine_smart_compile` → `pine_get_errors` |
| "Start replay at March 1st" | `replay_start` → `replay_step` → `replay_trade` |
| "Set up a 4-chart grid" | `pane_set_layout` → `pane_set_symbol` for each pane |
| "Draw a level at 24500" | `draw_shape` (horizontal_line) |
| "Take a screenshot" | `capture_screenshot` |

| Feature | How it saves context |
|---------|---------------------|
| Pine lines | Returns deduplicated price levels only, not every line object |
| Pine labels | Capped at 50 per study, text+price only |
| Pine tables | Pre-formatted row strings, no cell metadata |

| OHLCV summary mode | Stats + last 5 bars instead of all bars |
| Indicator inputs | Encrypted/encoded blobs auto-filtered |
| `verbose: true` | Pass on any pine tool to get raw data with IDs/colors when needed |
| `study_filter` | Target one indicator instead of scanning all |

## Finding TradingView on Your System

Launch scripts and `tv_launch` auto-detect TradingView. If auto-detection fails:

| Platform | Common Locations |
|----------|-----------------|
| **Mac** | `/Applications/TradingView.app/Contents/MacOS/TradingView` |
| **Windows** | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\TradingView\TradingView.exe`, `%PROGRAMFILES%\WindowsApps\TradingView*\TradingView.exe` |
| **Linux** | `/opt/TradingView/tradingview`, `~/.local/share/TradingView/TradingView`, `/snap/tradingview/current/tradingview` |

The key flag: `--remote-debugging-port=9222`

## Testing

```bash
# Requires TradingView running with --remote-debugging-port=9222
npm test
```

29 tests covering: Pine Script static analysis, server-side compilation, and CLI routing.

## Architecture

```
Claude Code  ←→  MCP Server (stdio)  ←→  CDP (port 9222)  ←→  TradingView Desktop (Electron)
```

- **Transport**: MCP over stdio (84 tools) + CLI (`tv` command, 30 commands with 66 subcommands)
- **Connection**: Chrome DevTools Protocol on localhost:9222
- **Streaming**: Poll-and-diff loop with deduplication, JSONL output to stdout
- **No dependencies** beyond `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` and `chrome-remote-interface`
